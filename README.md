# DelPlantsBelow
Minecraft plugin for removing buried plants and unwanted structures.
 
## üîó Requirement
Must be installed in Minecraft 1.12 or above.</br>
Latest version of CoreProtect is strongly recommended for recovery from unwanted edits.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Commands
`/delplantsbelow <radius> <material> [extra_materials]`</br>
`radius`: radius of area to be edited but in a shape of a square</br>
`material`: material to be set, block names must be used, and block IDs are not allowed.</br>
`extra_materials`: other materials to be included in selection for replacement

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings
Do not set `radius` to a overly large value, as this may cause huge lag for searching blocks in the area.</br>
If CoreProtect is not installed, edits cannot be undone. Therefore it is strongly recommended to have CoreProtect installed.</br>
Any misuse of the plugin may cause unexpected behaviour.
