# DelPlantsBelow
Minecraft plugin for removing buried plants and unwanted structures.
 
## üîó Requirement
Must be installed in Minecraft 1.12 or above.
Latest version of CoreProtect is strongly recommended for recovery from unwanted edits.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Commands
`/delplantsbelow <radius> <material> [extra_materials]`
`radius`: radius of area to be edited but in a shape of a square
`material`: material to be set, block names must be used, and block IDs are not allowed.
`extra_materials`: other materials to be included in selection for replacement

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings
Do not set `radius` to a overly large value, as this may cause huge lag for searching blocks in the area.
If CoreProtect is not installed, edits cannot be undone. Therefore it is strongly recommended to have CoreProtect installed.
Any misuse of the plugin may cause unexpected behaviour.
